    A scheduling analysis pass, :class:`~qiskit_ibm_provider.transpiler.passes.scheduling.ASAPScheduleAnalysis`
    has been added for Qiskit dynamic circuit (OpenQASM 3) backends. This is capable of handling
    scheduling for deterministic regions of a quantum circuit and may combined with a padding pass such as
    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_provider.transpiler.passes.scheduling.PadDelay` to pad schedulable sections of a
    circuit with delays.

    For an example see the :mod:`~qiskit_ibm_provider.transpiler.passes.scheduling` module's documentation.
