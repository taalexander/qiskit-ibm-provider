    The module :mod:`~qiskit_ibm_provider.transpiler`` has been added.

    Primarily, it will contain all specialized Qiskit routines for running
    applications on IBM's next-generation quantum devices that support dynamic
    capabilities such as control-flow(feedforward) and classical
    compute.
