upgrade:
  - Scheduling has been updated to reflect dynamic circuit backends. Measurements no longer interrupt
    scheduling. ALAP scheduling has now been implemented in
    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_provider.transpiler.passes.scheduling.ALAPScheduleAnalysis`
    and should be the standard scheduling policy that is used.
  - |
    A custom instruction durations class has been added for dynamic circuit backends
    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_provider.transpiler.passes.scheduling.DynamicCircuitInstructionDurations`.

    Currently it only patches the durations of measurement instructions.

    This should be used temporarily while we port legacy backends to dynamic circuit backends.
