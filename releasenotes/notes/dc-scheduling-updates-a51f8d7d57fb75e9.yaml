    A custom instruction durations class has been added for dynamic circuit backends
    :class:`~qiskit_ibm_provider.transpiler.passes.scheduling.DynamicCircuitInstructionDurations`.

    Currently it only patches the durations of measurement instructions.

    This should be used temporarily while we port legacy backends to dynamic circuit backends.
