    """Dynamic circuits scheduling analysis pass.

    This is a scheduler designed to work for the unique scheduling constraints of the dynamic circuits
    backends due to the limitations imposed by hardware. This is expected to evolve over time as the
    dynamic circuit backends also change.

    In its current form this is similar to Qiskit's ASAP scheduler in which instructions
    start as early as possible.

    The primary differences are that:

    * Measurements currently trigger the end of a "quantum block". The period between the end
        of the block and the next is *nondeterministic*
        ie., we do not know when the next block will begin (as we could be evaluating a classical
        function of nondeterministic length) and therefore the
        next block starts at a *relative* t=0.
    * It is possible to apply gates during a measurement.
    * Measurements on disjoint qubits happen simultaneously and are part of the same block.
        Measurements that are not lexicographically neighbors in the generated QASM3 will
        such as ``measure $0; x $1; measure $2;``
        happen in separate blocks.
